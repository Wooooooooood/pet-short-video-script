## Prompt Formula

The reliable structure for Seedance 2.0 prompts (40-80 words):

```
[Shot type], [subject with consistent visual details], [primary action], [secondary motion], [environment/location], [camera movement + speed], [lighting condition], [visual style + mood], [aspect ratio]
```

**Rules:**
- One primary action per prompt
- One camera movement per prompt
- Keep subject description identical across all shots for consistency
- Start with shot type (Seedance weights early tokens heavily)
- End with aspect ratio for the target platform
